<h2 id="-my-career"><img src="/assets/img/career.png" height="50px" /> My career</h2>

<p>I joined Datcapable in August 2018, to lead the Machine Learning efforts in threat event detection.</p>
<p>Ryan is an expert in Machine Learning technology and building engineering teams to deliver reliable products. Ryan has been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="http://www.datacapable.com/">Datacapable</a> and built a number of projects around analyzing social media text and tweets. He implemented an entity extractor using Twitter GloVe training set, built a labeling and training pipeline for classifying tweets to detect real-time threat events, and built a tweet clustering algorithm to assign auto-generated topics to tweets in real-time.</p>
<p>Before working at Datacapable, I ran a <a href="http://www.translateabroad.com/">Machine Learning consulting firm</a> for 3 years through a number of successful projects. One project was for a medical startup where my team and I built an algorithm to automatically detect and diagnose lesions in the lung for Cancer. Another project was a meditation and life coaching application for a firm in Palo Alto. Last we performed language analysis in the legal tech space categorizing documents and scrubbing confidential information.</p>
<p>Prior to working as a consultant, Ryan created <a href="http://www.waygoapp.com/">Waygo</a>, an instant visual translation service. He grew the company to 11 employees and launched both consumer and enterprise products. His work at Waygo required him to manage the product vision, set a go-to market strategy, and organize product launches for the entire company. In managing the product, he needed to coordinate design, customer development, and engineering to bring the product to market.</p>
