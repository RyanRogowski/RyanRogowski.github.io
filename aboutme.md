<!-- ### A brief summary of my career -->

<!-- ![career](/assets/img/career.png) --> 
![career](/assets/img/career.png){:style="float: left;margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"} I joined Datcapable in August 2018, to lead the Machine Learning efforts in threat event detection.

I am an expert in Machine Learning technology and building engineering teams to deliver reliable products. I am currently the Lead Machine Learning Engineer at [Datacapable](http://www.datacapable.com/) and have built a number of projects around analyzing social media text and tweets. I implemented an entity extractor using Twitter GloVe training set, built a labeling and training pipeline for classifying tweets to detect real-time threat events, and built a tweet clustering algorithm to assign auto-generated topics to tweets in real-time.

Before working at Datacapable, I ran a [Machine Learning consulting firm](http://www.translateabroad.com/) for 3 years through a number of successful projects. One project was for a medical startup where my team and I built an algorithm to automatically detect and diagnose lesions in the lung for Cancer. Another project was a meditation and life coaching application for a firm in Palo Alto. Last we performed language analysis in the legal tech space categorizing documents and scrubbing confidential information.

Prior to working as a consultant, I created [Waygo](http://www.waygoapp.com/), an instant visual translation service. I grew the company to 11 employees and launched both consumer and enterprise products. Waygo was a revolutionary translation app and was featured in New York Times, BBC Travel, Time Magazine and more.
